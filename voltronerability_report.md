###Voltronerability Report

After thoroughly poking at the site, I was unable to come up with any security voltronerabilities.
I was unable to get past the registration page.  As such, even though I know the site is not being protected against XSS, I was unable to access the form to add a journal entry to expose this voltronerability.  I was also able to verify that the site is protected against entries being altered by an unauthorized user, this is being checked.  Also, I was able to verify that the site is protected against CSRF voltronerabilities.  It would however, behoove paul to protect against XSS.
